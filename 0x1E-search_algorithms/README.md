# C - Search Algorithms

## C Algorithm

## Resources

### Read or watch:

- Search algorithm
- Space complexity (1)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
  - What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## More Info

You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:

- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n!)
- n*m -> O(nm)
- n square -> O(n^2)
- sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
- log(n) -> O(log(n))
- n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
